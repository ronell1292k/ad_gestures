# Ambient Dislay Gestures for AOSP ROMs





**What does this do:**

A simple module to add a few nifty ambient display tweaks to your AOSP ROM




*Hand Wave - Triggers Ambient Display
*Pick-up - Triggers Ambient Display
*Pocket - Triggers Ambient Display
*Proximity wake - Wakes device


**This does NOT add ambient display if your ROM doesn't have it**




**Compatibility:**
Anything AOSP. Works on almost all custom ROMs from Android versions Nougat to Pie. 
Does NOT work on Xiaomi Mi A1 stock ROMs (WIP)


**Credits:**
